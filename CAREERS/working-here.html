                <p>Based in Dallas, Texas, our KFC Global Office is the HQ of all things finger lickin' good. And we’re redefining what the future of work looks like. As a hybrid workplace, we trust our people to work in the way that's best for them, whether in the office or at home. Every month, we hold a collaboration week so everyone can get together, meet new joiners, see colleagues IRL and build relationships. But with tech tools at the heart of how we collaborate at KFC, we don't get culture or creativity FOMO, and have the chance to make connections on the days we WFH.</p>
