                    <div> <p><a href="#">KFC</a> is a global chicken restaurant brand with a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation.

Today, while honoring our heritage, we remain committed to modernizing the colonel's vision, by serving feel-good food, at scale, through inclusive, equitable and sustainable business practices.  We continue to follow his formula for success, with real cooks breading and freshly preparing our delicious chicken by hand in more than 30,000 restaurants in 150 countries and territories around the world.
